# Bottle-detector
The project detects by capturing image to tell whether image has a bottle or not.
This is the project made by my 2 friends and me,Here 2 datasets of images i.e. bottles and no bottles are imported,By using OpenCV the captured image is converted into array and this array dataset of images are trained into machine learning model to give required output.
